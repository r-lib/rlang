\title{Parse text into a quosure}
\usage{
parse_quosure(x, env = caller_env())

parse_quosures(x, env = caller_env())
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Text containing expressions to parse_expr for
\code{parse_expr()} and \code{parse_exprs()}. Can also be an R connection,
for instance to a file. If the supplied connection is not open,
it will be automatically closed and destroyed.}

\item{env}{The environment for the quosures. The \link[=global_env]{global environment} (the default) may be the right choice
when you are parsing external user inputs. You might also want to
evaluate the R code in an isolated context (perhaps a child of
the global environment or of the \link[=base_env]{base environment}).}
}
\description{
\Sexpr[results=rd, stage=render]{rlang:::lifecycle("deprecated")}

These functions were deprecated and renamed to \code{\link[=parse_quo]{parse_quo()}}
and \code{\link[=parse_quos]{parse_quos()}} in rlang 0.2.0. This is for consistency with the
convention that suffixes indicating return types are not
abbreviated.
