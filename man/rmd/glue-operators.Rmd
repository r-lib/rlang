```{r, child = "setup.Rmd", include = FALSE}
```

[Dynamic dots][dyn-dots] (and [data-masked][topic-data-mask] dots which are dynamic by default) have built-in support for names interpolation with the [glue package](https://glue.tidyverse.org/).

```{r, comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE}
tibble::tibble(foo = 1)

foo <- "name"
tibble::tibble("{foo}" := 1)
```

Inside functions, embracing an argument with `r link("{{")` inserts the expression supplied as argument in the string. This gives an indication on the variable or computation supplied as argument:

```{r, comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE}
tib <- function(x) {
  tibble::tibble("var: {{ x }}" := x)
}

tib(1 + 1)
```

See also [englue()] to string-embrace outside of dynamic dots.

```{r, comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE}
g <- function(x) {
  englue("var: {{ x }}")
}

g(1 + 1)
```

Technically, `r text("'{{'")` [defuses][topic-defuse] a function argument, calls [as_label()] on the expression supplied as argument, and inserts the result in the string.


## `r text("'{'")` and `r text("'{{'")`

While `glue::glue()` only supports `r text("'{'")`, dynamic dots support both `r text("'{'")` and `r text("'{{'")`. The double brace variant is similar to the embrace operator `r link("{{")` available in [data-masked][topic-data-mask] arguments.

In the following example, the embrace operator is used in a glue string to name the result with a default name that represents the expression supplied as argument:

```{r, comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE}
my_mean <- function(data, var) {
  data %>% dplyr::summarise("{{ var }}" := mean({{ var }}))
}

mtcars %>% my_mean(cyl)

mtcars %>% my_mean(cyl * am)
```

`r text("'{{'")` is only meant for inserting an expression supplied as argument to a function. The result of the expression is not inspected or used. To interpolate a string stored in a variable, use the regular glue operator `r text("'{'")` instead:

```{r, comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE}
my_mean <- function(data, var, name = "mean") {
  data %>% dplyr::summarise("{name}" := mean({{ var }}))
}

mtcars %>% my_mean(cyl)

mtcars %>% my_mean(cyl, name = "cyl")
```

Using the wrong operator causes unexpected results:

```{r, comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE}
x <- "name"

list2("{{ x }}" := 1)

list2("{x}" := 1)
```

Ideally, using `{{` on regular objects would be an error. However for technical reasons it is not possible to make a distinction between function arguments and ordinary variables. See `r link("topic_embrace_non_args")` for more information about this limitation.


## Allow overriding default names

The implementation of `my_mean()` in the previous section forces a default name onto the result. But what if the caller wants to give it a different name? In functions that take dots, it is possible to just supply a named expression to override the default. In a function like `my_mean()` that takes a named argument we need a different approach.

This is where [englue()] becomes useful. We can pull out the default name creation in another user-facing argument like this:

```{r, comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE}
my_mean <- function(data, var, name = englue("{{ var }}")) {
  data %>% dplyr::summarise("{name}" := mean({{ var }}))
}
```

Now the user may supply their own name if needed:

```{r, comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE}
mtcars %>% my_mean(cyl * am)

mtcars %>% my_mean(cyl * am, name = "mean_cyl_am")
```


## Using glue syntax in packages

Since rlang does not depend directly on glue, you will have to ensure that glue is installed by adding it to your `Imports:` section.

```r
usethis::use_package("glue", "Imports")
```
